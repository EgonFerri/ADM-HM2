## How do Taxis move in NYC?
In this assignment we perform an analysis of Taxis in NYC. In particular, we are curious to answer to some specific research questions (RQs) that may help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

For this purpose we use the open data of Taxi's trips in NYC. In order to answer to the RQs we take into account the data related to Yellow cab for the year 2018.

#### Download sets of articles

The data in usage are available on [Yellow cabs data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) (2018).
